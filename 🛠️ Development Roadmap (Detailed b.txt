🛠️ Development Roadmap (Detailed but High-Level)
Phase 1 – Setup Foundations

Choose the tech stack (Next.js + Supabase + OpenAI for web first).

Create the project repo and initial Next.js app.

Connect Supabase (database + auth + storage).

Deploy a “Hello World” page on Vercel (so you have something live early).

Phase 2 – Core Input Flow

Build Onboarding / Home screen with two buttons:

“Report a Problem”

“My Problem Log”

Build Report a Problem screen: upload photo, video, text, voice.

Send input to backend → call OpenAI API.

Phase 3 – AI Diagnosis

Show AI’s response:

Problem name, likely causes.

Actions:

“Show DIY Fix Suggestions”

“Find a Professional” (open external link)

“Save to My Problem Log”

Phase 4 – DIY Fix Suggestions

Display step-by-step text instructions + simple visuals.

Add “Mark as Tried” → updates problem status.

Phase 5 – Problem Log & Details

Build Problem Log screen (list of issues + statuses).

Build Problem Detail screen (photos, diagnosis, notes, status history).

Enable editing status (In Progress, Fixed, Not Fixed).

Phase 6 – Authentication & Accounts

Add user sign-in/up with Supabase Auth.

Make logs private (per user).

Phase 7 – Media & Voice

Reliable photo/video uploads → Supabase Storage.

Voice notes → Whisper API → text.

Phase 8 – Polishing & Safety

Handle loading states, error messages.

Add a short tutorial (Snap → Diagnose → Fix).

Improve styling & responsiveness.

Phase 9 – Launch Web App

Deploy to Vercel with production DB.

Add basic error tracking + analytics (Sentry, PostHog optional).

Phase 10 – Mobile Apps

Start Expo project.

Reuse logic (same API + database).

Build same screens for Android & iOS.

Publish to app stores.
